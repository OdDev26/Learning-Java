Multithreading allows you to utilize the full CPU of your machine. It allows you execute tasks in parallel
An example of a multithreaded application: An application that exposes three threads that allows the client download seperate parts of
an image concurrently.



Benefits of multithreading
1. It can make our application faster, meaning we can achieve more in less time e.g We can create separate threads
to download 10 files instead of one to download all.

Concurrency problems
1. Race conditions: This occur when multiple threads are racing/competing to modify the same resource at the same time
2. Visibility problem: When the state of the shared resource is seen differently by the different threads

When building applications that use multiple threads, we must ensure they are thread safe meaning these problems must be addressed
